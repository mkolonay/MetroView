<h1>CURA</h1>
<p>cura@vcu.edu</p>
<p>The Center for Urban and Regional Analysis (CURA) was  established by the Virginia General Assembly as the Virginia Center for Urban Development in 1992. We serve government, business and non-profit organizations at the town, city and regional levels with one main goal in mind &mdash; to help you focus your efforts, use your resources efficiently and make you more effective at what you do.</p>
<h3>What we do</h3>
<p><strong>Policy and program evaluation</strong> &ndash; We analyze economic, social and fiscal impacts that show what has changed as the result of a policy or program, do best-practice case studies that show why things work well when they do and how to replicate success, and set benchmarks and metrics that help you stay on track and show future impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Decision support systems</strong> &ndash; We construct decision models that help you determine where and how to allocate resources, we develop information systems that help you understand the lay of the land, how things are changing and how they are likely to change, and we build indicator systems to monitor critical changes in community and regional economies that may require new policies.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic planning</strong> &ndash; We conduct economic development studies for towns, cities and regions to identify new economic uses that bring vitality to communities. We work with mature commercial corridors and downtowns in distress, conducting competitive market studies and creating development strategies to make these areas viable for the 21st century.</p>
<h3>How we work</h3>
<p><strong>Focus on implementation and practice</strong> &ndash; We are academics and our work is grounded in sound methods, but we don&rsquo;t live in an ivory tower. We take pride in work that is focused on the practical action steps that our clients can take to get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>After-market service</strong> &ndash; We are consultants, but we don&rsquo;t run off after we&rsquo;ve finished a study or service. We remain on call to help you work through implications and action steps.</p>
