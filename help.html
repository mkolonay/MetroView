<h1>Loading times:</h1>
The queries themselves run very quickly and you should see no real lag after requesting data. You will experience lags for map parcel data redraws - especially at larger scales.
<h1>Selecting a study area:</h1>
You begin any study in Metroview by selecting a study area from the map. You may select as many map areas as you choose by any of the selection methods. For each new geography you select you will get a new tab in the results section You can select a study area in a number of ways:
<ul>
    <li><b>Select by Buffer</b>  - This is the default tool and it allows you to click on the map and draw a buffer around it. In the Map Selection tools area choose the 'Buffering a point' option from the dropdown, set the buffer distance that you want to use and click on the map.  </li>
    <li><b>Select by Polygon</b> - This search option allows you freehand draw a polygon to examine. In the Map Selection tools area choose the 'Drawing a polygon' option from the dropdown, click on the 'Click to start drawing' button, move your mouse pointer over the map and hold the left mouse button down to begin drawing. Release the button to complete the polygon.  </li>
    <li><b>Select by Searching</b> - This search allows you to define a point on the map from an address. Simply type in the address into the search option at the top of the page. The address search will use the buffer distance you set for the buffer. </li>
</ul>
<h1>Using the Filters:</h1>
Parcels may be filtered based on their attributes. These filters apply to both the map and to the results panel for parcels.
<ul>
    <li><b>Property Types</b> - By default all property types are used. To limit the type of property used in your study check one or more of the property types from the filter. </li>
    <li><b>Parcel Attributes</b> - By default there are no filters applied to the parcels. You may refine your query using  the parcel attributes: Construction Year, Land Value, Building/Improvements Value, and Parcel Square feet. You may enter either of the top or bottom values for your query. Click off of the textbox to finish the query.</li>
    <i>Note - Once you have created tables and graphs based on filter criteria changes to the filter will not affect the results.</i>
</ul>
<h1>Viewing the results:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>If you do not need the map section once you have selected your geographies you can collapse it by clicking on the grey bar just above the map</li>
    <li>For each of the geographies you select you will see a new tab in the results section.</li>
    <li>The color of the results tab will match the polygon on the map.</li>
    <li>In the results section there are currently 3 data sets available - parcel data, household income data, and employment by sector data.</li>
    <li>For each of the results table you can add or remove fields by clicking on the plus sign in the top right of the table.</li>
